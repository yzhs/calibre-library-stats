# library-stats

The purpose of this program is to generate statistics about a Calibre library.
It is very much specific to my personal setup, both regarding file paths and
database setup. *I'm quite certain, that it will not be of use for anyone else,
except maybe as a source of inspiration, or as some example Rust code.*
