My library currently contains a total of {{all.works}} pieces of writing (novels, novellas, short stories, text books, etc.) with an estimated {{all.pages}} pages.  These contain more then {{all.words}} words.  That includes the number of words in works which can be easily counted, e.g. EPUB files, and unreliable – mostly too low – word counts of PDF or DJVU files.

Of these I have read

  * {{read.long.works}} books, {{read.long.pages}} pages, {{read.long.words}} in total;
  * {{english.read.long.works}} books, {{english.read.long.pages}} pages, {{english.read.long.words}} words in English;
  * {{german.read.long.works}} books, {{german.read.long.pages}} pages, {{german.read.long.words}} words in German; and
  * {{english.read.short.works}} works of less than {{min_words}} words and less than {{min_pages}} pages in English, totalling {{english.read.short.pages}} pages, and {{english.read.short.words}} words.

Thus, in total, I have read {{all.read.works}} works consisting of {{all.read.works}} pages and {{all.read.works}} words.
